# Unhandled Division by Zero in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unhandled division by zero.  The `foo` function attempts to divide `a` by `b` without checking if `b` is zero. This leads to an error when the function is called with a zero denominator.

The bug is corrected in `bugSolution.js`, where the code explicitly handles the case of division by zero.
